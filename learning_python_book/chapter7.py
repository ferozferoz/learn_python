"""operator overloading - we redefine class built in methods like __init__ constructor, __str__ method that is called when the instance of class
is created """

"""polymorphism - the method will be dynamically resolved class instance. if the instance contains methods, will be picked otherwise parent 
 class and so on . Also called as customizing behaviour"""

"""what is encapsulation -  the encapsulation is the process of defining the fuction as higher in the hierarchy that is simply plugged
and played in the child functions. If any change is required the change should happen at one place. the logic should not be spread across
that there will be maintenability issues. Encapsulation helps when implementing polymorphism  in customizing classes"""
